# League Drops Extension
This is a Chrome extension that checks for upcoming League of Legends matches and opens the appropriate stream when they start.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn on Developer mode
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you cloned or downloaded the repository

## Usage
The extension will automatically check for upcoming matches every 5 minutes and open a new tab with the stream of the match if it is about to start. If a match has already finished, the extension will close the tab with the stream.

Click on the extension icon in the top right corner of Chrome to see the list of upcoming matches.

## Disclaimer
This extension is not affiliated with Riot Games or any of its partners. Use it at your own risk.


## Constributing 
Feel free to open a pull request if you can help, I have no clue about javascript or chrome extensions so I made this pretty fast so there might be some bugs and shitty code.

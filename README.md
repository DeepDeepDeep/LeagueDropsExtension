# LoL Esports Watcher Chrome Extension
The extension will automatically open a new window when a match is about to begin, and then close the window when the match has ended. 

# Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn on Developer mode
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you cloned or downloaded the repository

# Usage
The extension periodically checks for new matches every five minutes and automatically opens a new window when a match is about to begin in less than 10 minutes. Once the match is over, the extension will close the window. 

### Popup Option:

Window State: The window state option in the popup allows the user to choose the state of the window that will be opened when a new match is detected. The available options are "Normal", "Minimized", and "Maximized".

If you have the Memory Saver feature enabled, add lolesports.com to the exclusion:

Feel free to open a pull request if you can help, I have no clue about javascript or chrome extensions so I made this pretty fast so there might be some bugs and shitty code.

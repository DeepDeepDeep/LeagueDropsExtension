# League Esports Watcher Chrome Extension
This is a Chrome extension that automatically opens games on lolesports.com in a new tab. This is helpful if you don't want to miss games.

2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn on Developer mode
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you cloned or downloaded the repository

# Usage
The extension will automatically check for upcoming matches every 5 minutes and open a new window if it is about to start. When the match finishes, the extension will close the window.
Click on the extension icon in the top right corner of Chrome to see the list of upcoming matches.

Feel free to open a pull request if you can help, I have no clue about javascript or chrome extensions so I made this pretty fast so there might be some bugs and shitty code.
